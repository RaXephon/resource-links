# Instructions for Submitting Challenges

### 1.  Submitting Files
a)  Submit IPython notebook over *.py files.  Makes it easier to follow:  code, output & graphs
b)  Submit 1 file.  Don't submit several versions of a file.


### 2.  Labeling Challenges
Label challenge numbers in bold.

### 3.  Graphs
All graphs should have a title.  Also, label both x and y axes.






1.  Submit IPython notebook (instead of *.py files).  This makes it easier to follow the code, output and graphs.

2.  Label your challenges, preferably in bold.

3.  Graphs - All graphs should have a title.  Also, both x and y axes should have labels.

4.  To compare results consistently, where applicable, use:  test_size=0.30, random_state=4444
5.  Don't print copious output in your IPython notebook.  For dictionaries, print 1 or 2 key, value pairs.  Try to print, at most, 100 rows of data (of data frame or array).
