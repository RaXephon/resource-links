```
In statistics, the generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear 
regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a 
normal distribution. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related 
to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each 
measurement to be a function of its predicted value.
