Set 4 (Linear Learning) 

To review, you simulated data from distributions with the following assumptions:  logarithmic or quadratic data
You graphed the data and looked at the distributions visually.
- log is the inverse of exponential
- if data are increasing in an exponential way, take the log so it makes the distribution more linear

Poisson<br>
>discrete distribution
the pmf (probability mass function) has an "e = exp" in there
provides an appropriate description of the number of occurrences per interval of time

Exponential<br>
>continuous distribution
the pdf (probability density function) also has an "e = exp" in there
provides a  description of the length of time between occurrences
