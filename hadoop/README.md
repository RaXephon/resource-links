**HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System)

[Full List of HDFS Commands](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html)  

**HDFS**  
•  name node (master): maintains name system, manages data blocks  
•  data nodes (slave): deployed storage machines. MapReduce analyses happen here

**Impala**  
the first real time query engine

**Hadoop** = HDFS + MapReduce

**MapReduce**  
•  map function: turns data into (key, value) pairs  
•  reduce function: reduce all values for key to one value or set


**Hadoop YARN**  
a resource-management platform responsible for managing computing resources in clusters and using them to schedule of users' applications

**Apache Spark**  
•  Popularized in ~ 2013-2014  
–  load all the data into memory  
–  up to ~100 -mes faster than MapReduce –  itera-ve algorithms become reasonable!
