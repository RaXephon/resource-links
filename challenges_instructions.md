# Instructions for Submitting Challenges

### 1.  GitHub Folder Naming Convention
Use lower-case names and underscores, preferably your first name.  (This is because GitHub folder/file names are case-sensitive.).  In the case there is someone in the class with your same first name, you can use:  firstname_lastname for folder name. 

### 1.  Submitting Files
a)  Submit IPython notebook for challenges instead of *.py files.  Makes it easier to follow:  code, output & graphs
b)  Submit 1 file.  (Don't submit several versions of files.)

### 2.  Labeling Challenges
Label challenge numbers in bold.

### 3.  Graphs
All graphs should have a title.  Also, label both x and y axes.

### 4.  Comparing results
To compare results consistently, where applicable, use:  test_size=0.30, random_state=4444.  You can always experiment with different test_size and random_state, but for submission purposes, use the given settings.

### 5.  Don't print copious output in your IPython notebook.  
For dictionaries, print a few key/value pairs.  Try to print, at most, 100 rows of data (of data frame or array).

### 6.  GitHub - notices
Your GitHub settings should be set to receive email notifications by email.  Below are instructions on setting this up:
1.  In GitHub, on upper right corner, click on your profile picture, then "Settings"
2.  On left menu, under "Personal Settings", click on "Notification Center"
3.  On right menu, under "Participating", make sure both boxes, "Email" and "Web" are checked.
