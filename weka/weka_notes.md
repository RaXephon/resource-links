####Weka Notes

This is a hands-on task using Weka.  Please load the dataset “mailing_tree.arff" and build a tree using the J48 classifier induction technique.  

Recall: you choose the induction technique using the Choose button on the Classify tab; J48 is under “trees”.  Before you run the algorithm, please change the minNumObj option to 100. You get to the option menu by right clicking on the bar next to the ‘Choose’ button that should say ‘J48’ after you selected the technique. Copy the results from the large window and submit with your homework.  Look through the statistics at the bottom.  We will cover many of those in the weeks that follow, as we build up a repertoire of model performance analytics.
