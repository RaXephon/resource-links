Set global bash profile (run once and the setup will be retained)

```
$ pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh
$ emacs ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile

```

Set local session bash profile (must be re-run each time terminal is started)

```
$ pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh
$ emacs .bash_profile
$ source .bash_profile
```
