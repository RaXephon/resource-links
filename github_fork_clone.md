### Fork a repo, clone a repo, set upstream

#### Step 1:
In my personal account on GitHub, go to repo to be cloned.

In this example, it is:  https://github.com/thisismetis/ds5

#### Step 2:  Fork repo
Upper right of github page:  "Fork" the repo

Go to my forked repo: https://github.com/reshama/ds5
 
#### Step 3:
Clone that forked repo (which is now under my name)

In right column, find the link to **HTTPS clone URL** and copy that URL to be cloned.

In terminal: 
* go to directory where repo will be cloned
* clone repo
* cd into clone repo
```
$ metisgh
$ pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh/_ds/metis/metisgh

$ cd metisgh/
$ ls

$ git clone https://github.com/reshama/ds5.git
$ cd ds5
```
