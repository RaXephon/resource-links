**Open terminal window & navigate to folder**  
```
$ dvrs
$ pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh/_ds/metis/metisgh/dataviz_rs
```
**Open files using sublime editor**  
```
$ sublime .
```
Back in the terminal, fire up the web server so that you can preview your code in a web browser:  
```
$ http-server &
```
With http-server running, visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser and refresh whenever you make changes. Iterate as many times as you like to develop your example, bouncing between your text editor and web browser.
