Sometimes we are asked about running Windows for class. The short answer is this: Don't run Windows.

The slightly longer answer is that it is possible to run Windows, but everything is harder. I've never had a student do the class with Windows. I had a student start the class with Windows, but by the second day that student went out and bought a new computer because it was too hard to keep up in Windows.

You don't necessarily need to buy a new computer. Here are some alternatives:

 * If your computer is fairly powerful, you could run a Linux Virtual Machine inside your normal Windows install. This requires some configuration, but at least you end up with a working Linux instead of having to try to make Windows do things.
 * You could install Linux on your computer instead of or alongside Windows. Then you can boot to Linux instead of booting to Windows. Again, there is a good deal of configuration to be done to get this to work well, in general. We've had a couple people do the class with Linux this way.
 * You could `ssh` into a remote Linux machine on EC2 and do all your work there. This requires some setup but perhaps less than the above two options. You'll mostly forgo a graphical interface, most likely, and you'll be paying for your computing by the hour.
 * You could try to use git-bash and/or other tools to try to make Windows achieve the functionality of Linux/MacOS. This becomes pretty frustrating pretty frequently and may limit the tools you can use.

Most people use Macs. They're too expensive, but they work really well and they have a Linux-similar operating system that lets you just get down to business.

If you want to spend time learning how to configure things, I recommend learning how to configure Linux over learning how to configure Windows.
